## My Bio

As an Information Systems major who is interested in data science and working with large datasets, I have strong course knowledge in Advances in Data Science, Database Design and Management, Engineering Big-Data Systems and Application Engineering Development. I possess the ability to build accurate machine learning models and I am familiar with big data technologies like Hadoop. I have worked with various databases and have a firm understanding of their querying functions and I am also a technically competent Java developer.  Along the way to earning my undergraduate degree, I also developed a strong background in mathematics that has served me well in my pursuit of becoming a data scientist. During my Internship with Argus Ventures, I was a full stack web developer involved in developing a web application for a talent finder website called TalentX. As a former intern in Universiti Sains Malaysia, I created an Android application which receives real-time data from sensors connected to an Edison board and displays them in a graphical format. This was a team project on IoT, where I was able to collaborate with fellow team members and learn new techniques.
